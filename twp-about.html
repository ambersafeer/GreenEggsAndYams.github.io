	<p> My first name is Amber, but online I go by the pseudonym "amberyams" on account of my love for candied sweet potatoes and the fact that I prefer the nickname "yams" to "ams." I am a sophomore at Rutgers University majoring in computer science and minoring in art. Currently, I am the Creative Director at <em>The Rutgers Review</em>, an arts and culture magazine (check us out <a href="https://www.therutgersreview.com/" target="_blank"> here</a>) where I oversee the design of the magazine and collaborate with some really amazing peers! I have also conducted research regarding the uses of digital technologies, such as social media and artificial intelligence, for social good, which you can read a bit about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-safeer/overlay/1635537281080/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAD2qtcUBV_dnIVcmx7o3dFQEvuOMef_Xhbk" target="_blank"> here</a>.
	</p>
	<p> In my less academic endeavors, I enjoy practicing and learning about all facets of creativity such as drawing, painting, playing ukulele, singing, musical theater, fashion, reading, and so much more (it's like Pok√©mon... gotta catch 'em all!). I also really love being with my friends to try new restaurants (or stick to old classics, like Henry's Diner), go thrifting, visit the city, or play Mario Party and Animal Crossing. My current obsession is this new <em> Mean Girls</em> movie discourse floating around-- which I have yet to see, so <em><strong> please</strong></em> no spoilers, if there are any. I was a lover of the original 2000s hit as well as the broadway musical so... I have many opinions.

	<p> I am from an undisclosed town in Central Jersey (because I've moved around a bit in my life) but I am no stranger to our shimmering coasts and crowded boardwalks. I've also been a lover of nature, as I used to go camping and fishing a lot when I was younger. When I reminisce about the past, I think of it fondly. However, when looking to the future, I grow fearful of rising dangers. This is why the Trash of the Week Project is so important to me. It is not just a place to unearth my deepest secrets and habits, but rather a way to hold myself accountable for the waste I produce. I loved this planet years ago when I walked barefoot in creeks and tried hard to play with squirming salamanders and fluttering fireflies, and I still love it now. However, it is need of deep reparations, and it is the duty of humans to provide that to our home. Join me on this journey of self-discovery both on this website here and more personally through my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ambersafe.er/" target="_blank"> instagram page</a>. </p>
